This is an app that I made without watching any tuitorials but based on just my skills and logic. It was tpugh, I'm not gonna lie. Nut I learned through all my problems and completed this app in 16 hours.
This app has a toss page where you get the experience of an actual toss i.e Heads or Tails.

If you win the toss, you get choose whether you want to bat first or bowl first.

If you lose the toss, the system will decide if it wants to bat first or bowl first

Then comes the actual game where you get to choose a number between 1 and 6 and continue doing that until one of them gets out. It also shows a mid-innings screen with the target.
